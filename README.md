Purpose:
- This application addresses the issue of individuals going on dates with misrepresented or dishonest individuals. Many people experience unpleasant dates, often due to a lack of knowledge and intentions about the person they are meeting.

Programming Framework
- Django is a framework for building websites and web applications quickly using Python. It helps organize the different parts of a web project like handling data, creating web pages, and managing user accounts. With Django, developers can focus on making their website unique instead of spending time on basic setup. It's popular because it's easy to use and has lots of helpful features built-in.

Programming Language:
- Python is like a friendly language that lots of people use because it's easy to understand and work with. You can do all sorts of things with it, from building websites to crunching numbers or even making your computer do stuff automatically. Plus, there are tons of other people who use Python too, so it's easy to get help and find cool stuff others have made.

Python Libraries:
- Python authentication is all about making sure that the right people can access a website or app. It involves tasks like signing up, logging in, and controlling who gets to see what. Python offers different ways to do this, like using passwords, letting users sign in with their social media accounts, or giving them special codes to access certain parts. It's important for keeping things safe and making sure only the right folks can get in.
